Challenging bits

Catriona - Delete Modal / getting user id from payload  - need to call the user from ther service. printing user to confirm data and which user it is 
Cameron - using angular holistically - until now it has been in pieces and fragments so it has been useful to learn how to combine all these elements. Working with an API and embedding google places - but then great to find angular scripts which make life a lot easier.  
Hannah - Comments and returning res in the back end controller functions - also console logging and grabbing properties from api objects 

learned:
we have worked in teams but how to work as a team when coding 
technical side of working in a developer team
softer skills - regular and consistent communication
one of the benefits of a group project - is having people who understand your project and you can talk things through, take a step back and you can support each other and avoid rabbit holes!
individual morale boosted by help from each other
GIT PROCESS

easier in person but if we were working remotely needs to be even more carefully considered 

benefit - allowing time to tackle problems you might not have time to do on your own

but you don't necessarily get to learn or understand things more broadly

but now we have each other as future resources and an example to work from and review

took on things we wanted to learn about but equally shying away from choosing things we were bad at because we didn't want to slow people down. 


easyish 
catriona - setting up the core app 
Also challenging to understand why something wasn't working or a test failing whether you needed to still write some code or if it was someone else's responsibility - how to make it work in a group context 

hannah - testing - like it but it illuminated how I didn't fully understand what some code was doing so useful to force me to look at code in more granular detail

cam - setting up the back end - tried and tested recipe - setting up routes and getting the express app together
